Jen completed an internship within BMW's engineering department, which is repsonsible for defining US market requirements, analyzing customer data and carrying out validation and deployment tasks for all areas of digital BMW Group products. 

She was based out of the Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey office of BMW of North America, working remotely in the home office for most of the assignment. While BMW internships typically last 6 months, Jen accepted an offer to extend her assignment into Summer 2022.

Jen was a strong contributor to the overall team with specific focus in the field of large-scale customer data analysis for improving testing and implementation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). In the course of her internship, her main work results and achievements were:
 
 • Supervised BMW of North America's migration of the data handling infrastructure to AWS <br>
 • Analyzed customer data to determine feature statistics and identify patterns <br>
 • Created geolocation maps with implication on the performance of autonomous driving features <br>
 • Validated new feature signals being tested in AWS <br>
 
The main tools in this assignment were PySpark or SQL for large-scale data processing, AWS/EMR for data management, and data analysis/statistical packages for Python.
