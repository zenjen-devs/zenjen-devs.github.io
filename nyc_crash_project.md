## Deep-Dive Data Mining: Analyzing Pre & Post-COVID Car Crash Data in NYC
<br>
The goal of this analysis is to explore the data for any interesting findings through an exploratory analysis. Potential findings from the data may be important insight for drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists in NYC. <br>

The analysis examined the data for patterns and any points of interest pertaining to car accidents in the five boroughs. This data is also useful for infrastructure development, and to inform policies or technologies that can make travel on roads safer. <a href="pdfs/NYC_CrashData_EDA_2019-2022_JenArriaza.pdf" class="image fit"><b>View the full report here </b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/376/376007.png" height="12" width="12"/></a>

A times series analysis of data from January 2019 to March 2022 shows that accident numbers fell to about half at the peak of quarantine. But what's more interesting is what numbers <b> did not fall</b>: <br>

<i>Less accidents, but rising fatalities</i>. Although there are significantly less vehicles on the road during and after the pandemic in NYCâ€”and subsequently less accidents. The number of accident-related fatalities is showing an upward trend in the above graph, potentially due to an increase of pedestrian and cyclists traffic during quarantine. <br>
  
Further exploration of the data revelead other interesing factors, i.e.; locations with high fatalities, and sedans vs. SUVs. <a href="pdfs/NYC_CrashData_EDA_2019-2022_JenArriaza.pdf" class="image fit"><b>For the full project report click here.</b></a>
