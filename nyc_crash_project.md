## Deep-Dive Data Mining: Analyzing Pre & Post-COVID Car Crash Data in NYC

This analysis examined data for patterns and  points of interest pertaining to car accidents in the NYC boroughs. Results are useful for development of technology and to inform programs that can mitigate the ecnonic impacts and loss of life due to traffic accidents. This project was completed using mainly Python libraries and Tableau. <a href="pdfs/NYC_CrashData_EDA_2019-2022_JenArriaza.pdf" class="image fit"><b>View the full report here </b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/376/376007.png" height="12" width="12"/></a>

A times series analysis of data from January 2019 to March 2022 shows that accident numbers fell to about half at the peak of quarantine. But what's more interesting is what numbers <b> did not fall</b>: <br>

<i><b>Less accidents, but rising fatalities</b></i>. Although there are significantly less vehicles and overall accidents on NYC roads as expected post-COVID, pedestrian deaths continue on an upward trend as seen in the graph. This phenomena may be due to increased driver anxiety, larger vehicles, and changes in social norms as discussed in this [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/pedestrian-deaths-pandemic.html). <br>
  
Further exploration of the data revelead other interesing factors, i.e.; locations with high fatalities, and sedans vs. SUVs. <a href="pdfs/NYC_CrashData_EDA_2019-2022_JenArriaza.pdf" class="image fit"><b>For the full project report click here.</b></a>
