Based on historical data available with respect to NYC crash incidents, I developed a model to classify whether an accident is deemed severe/not severe. The model is a **binary classifier** in which target variable *serious accident* is either *True/False* dependent on whether at least one injury was reported. 

The dataset contains approximately 1.2 million records, each representing a motor vehicle accident that occurred within the 5 boroughs of NYC between April 2012 and August 2022. This is the entirety of the crash data available as of August 2022, accessed directly from NYC OpenData.
